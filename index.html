          <p>I love to travel. Due to a series of life events, we stopped traveling for a while. I'm excited that we are able to start back up again. Please take a look at some of our past international travel destinations. Enjoy! </p>

                <h2 class="city">Vancouver</h2>
            <p>This was my first international trip. I recently revisited this city in November 2022. It's a wonderful place with the best bubble tea around.</p>

            <p>This trip was amazing. My spouse and I were able to lounge under the palm trees on the beach and float in the ocean.</p>

					<h2 class="city">London</h2>
					<p>This was an anniversary trip. My husband's dream was to travel to London. It was a little disorienting trying to figure out which way to look in order to cross the street. Never the less, this was an experience of a lifetime.</p>

					<h2 class="city">Paris</h2>
					<p>We traveled to Paris during our trip to London. We took the Eurostar train through the Chunnel. The Chunnel is an under the sea tunnel linking England and France. The ride lasted a little over 2 hours. Once there, we were able to see the Eiffel Tower, Notre Dame Cathedral, and the Louvre Museum. The architecture was amazing and the people were very friendly.  </p>

					<p> During this trip, we were able to take a small glass bottom boat to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. The view was amazing. </p>

					<p> We weren't here for long. The food smelled wonderful and looking out over the coast line was a sight to behold. </p>

					<h2 class="city">Puerto Vallarta</h2>
					<p>We stopped for lunch at a restaurant at the top of a hill. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name. I was able to score some vanilla that was so wonderfully fragrant. Later, we traveled by boat to a rock formation called Los Arcos.</p>

				<p>This trip was the absolute best. We went on a tour that took us around the whole island. The tour guide stopped and gave us samples of Tamarind. He also gave me a fragrant flower for my hair and his personal art work. </p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>

        <h3>Crochet</h3>

      <p>I learned to crochet while finishing Graduate School. I needed an outlet for stress and it proved to be a life saver. I've created many things from shark slippers to market bags. My dream is to one day create an e-commerce business selling my creations.</p>
  
      <h3>Photography</h3>

      <p> I began my love of photography as a child. My father sparked this interest for me. He had older Kodak and Polaroid cameras that he would allow me to experiment with. These cameras were instant so I could see my results immediately. </p>
      
      <h3>Video Games</h3>

      <p>I remember playing videos with my mom as a child. The video game of choice back then was Atari 2600 during that time. </p>
      <p>Thank you for visiting.  I appreciate you taking the time to get to know me.  Updates will be coming soon. </p>
